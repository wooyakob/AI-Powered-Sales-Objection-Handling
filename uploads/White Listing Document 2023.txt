Learnwise-Go
uses
SendGrid,
one
of
the
largest
PaaS
for
email
delivery
and
implements
all
the 
recommended
practices
for
ensuring
higher
probability
of
email
delivery
to
end
recipients 
including
Domain
authentication.
As
you
know,
domain
authentication,
formally
known
as
domain
white
label,
shows
email 
providers
that
SendGrid
has
your
permission
to
send
emails
on
LearnwiseGos
behalf.
Explicitly
stating
that
it
comes
from
LearnWiseGo
increases
the
reputation
with
email
service 
providers
which
makes
it
much
less
likely
that
they
will
filter
the
mail
and
not
allow
it
get
to 
recipient's
inbox,
which
increases
the
deliverability.
We
are
also
explicitly
showing
your
recipients
that
this
email
comes
from
LearnWiseGo,
so
they 
are
less
likely
to
mark
the
mail
as
spam.
Domain
authentication
allows
SendGrid
to
handle
the 
signing
of
DKIM
and
authentication
of
SPF
for
outbound
email
with
CNAME
records.
Please
note
that
even
though
on
the
sending
side,
we
have
set
both
DKIM
and
SPF
(via 
Domain
authentication),
it
does
not
guarantee
100%
delivery
of
emails.
There
are
too
many 
other
factors
which
also
could
potentially
cause
a
receiver
to
mark
a
mail
as
spam:
1.       Spam
filters
blocking
SendGrid
by
marking
SendGrid
as
spam
server
itself 
2.       Spam
filters
also
look
at
the
content
of
the
email

if
the
link
to
text
ratio
or
images 
to
text
ratio
is
high,
mail
is
marked
as
spam.
Different
spam
filters
have
different 
thresholds 
3.       IP
address
used
by
SendGrid
to
send
emails
has
been
marked
as
spam
server 
4.       User
explicitly
marking
email
as
spam 
5.       Too
many
emails
generated
to
same
domain
within
a
short
span
of
period
(mass 
emailing)
Solution:
To
send
an
email
out
from
Learn-WiseGo
Administrator
to
all
your
users
telling
them
to
not
mark 
emails
from
LearnWiseGo
as
Spam.
Add the
IP
Address 
168.245.118.31 
to
your
email
server
SPF
record.

these
are
whitelisted:
