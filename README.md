## Overview
Sensai Group was an incorporated business in California, building new sales tools using the latest AI technologies. Our first tool was a sales objection handler, able to use product information to advise sales reps on how to best overcome objections to selling their products. 

The problem this tool was aiming to solve was the lack of ongoing sales training available to most sales reps.

### Example:
> This project is a containerized web application deployed on Microsoft Azure designed to help sales reps from all over the world better handle product specific sales objections. It enables users to add product information easily, and practice handling sales objections with an AI assistant. The primary goal is to give sales reps access to 24/7 sales training from any device, anywhere in the world.
